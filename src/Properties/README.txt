Do NOT remove the file BuildId.cs.in.
The file "BuildId.cs" will be generated by the script "BuildId-update.sh" during the pre-build process.
The script will automatically update the last svn revision in the build number and/or the last git commit hash.
You can edit the file "BuildId.cs.in" to generate "BuildId.cs", but do NOT modify the lines containing "%svnrev%" or "%githash%".
